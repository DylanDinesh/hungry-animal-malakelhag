# Hungry Animal Tutorial
This is the README.md file.

I started by adding a kangaroo and made it able to move left and right, I made fries, and changed the background. 
I added sound every time the kangaroo ate the fries + did some stuff we covered in class.

Extras - 
The kangaroo can jump whenever you press "j" (just for fun, and to freeze time)
The game shows the current score when the game is over
When the game is over you can press "space" to start it again
some fries are special (they give you an extra point) + display a message that u got an extra point
